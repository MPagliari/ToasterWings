# 🪶 Flying ToasterWings 🪶

A flying toaster screensaver made with **Godot 4.x** — a nostalgic homage to the classic After Dark "Flying Toasters" screensaver, reimagined with some quirky wings and modern flair.

## 🛠️ About the Project

This is a fun little side project I built for no real reason other than the joy of watching toasters fly across the screen. It's built entirely in Godot 4 and outputs a `.exe` file that you can convert into a Windows-compatible `.scr` screensaver.

⚠️ **Note**: The code is admittedly a bit messy — I had plans to clean it up, but honestly, life happened. So I'm releasing it as-is and leaving it to the internet to do what it does best (probably roast me 🔥).

## 📦 Installation Instructions

1. Download the EXE build of the project.

3. Copy or move the `.scr` file to your `C:\Windows\System32` folder (requires admin privileges).
4. Open the **Screen Saver Settings** panel in Windows.
5. Choose `ToasterWings` from the list and click **Preview** to see those glorious winged toasters in action!
